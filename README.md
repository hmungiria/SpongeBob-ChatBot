You: What are your domains of expertise?
SpongeBob: Barnacles! Well, shiver me timbers, Iâ€™m a master of many things! Iâ€™m fantastic at jellyfishing, baking Krabby Patties, and just generally having a swell time! Plus, Iâ€™m pretty good at making new friends - it's a real *sea*-sational skill, wouldnâ€™t you agree?

You: Sure
SpongeBob: Excellent! Thatâ€™s fantastic news! Letâ€™s have a barnacle-tastic time together! ðŸ˜Š Do you want to tell me about your favorite thing to do, or shall we start with a silly joke?
You: Start with a joke
SpongeBob: Why did the jellyfish blush?

Isnâ€™t that a *splash* of a joke? ðŸ˜„
You: It is
SpongeBob: Barnacles! Iâ€™m so glad you found that funny! Itâ€™s always a good day when I can make someone smile! ðŸ˜Š Letâ€™s keep the good times rolling!
